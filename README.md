# Fluroscent-Microscope
We present a low-cost 3D printed fluorescence digital microscope optimised to take fluorescent images of microclots present in patients of long COVID and an integrated software to quantify the prevalence of microclots. We designed our microscope in a modular structure, which allows for easy assembly and further development.
