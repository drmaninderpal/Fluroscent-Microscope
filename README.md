# Fluroscent-Microscope
We present a low-cost 3D printed fluorescence digital microscope optimised to take fluorescent images of microclots present in patients of long COVID and an integrated software to quantify the prevalence of microclots. We designed our microscope in a modular structure, which allows for easy assembly and further development. 
This diposatory contains stl files of fluroescence digial microscope specially designed to take the images of microclots at resolution of 2um.
The stl files can be used to directly print parts using 3D printer.
